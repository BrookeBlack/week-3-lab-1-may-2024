  <br>
  <h3 style="font-family: fantasy;">Here are some excerpts from "www.space.com"</h3>
  <p style="background-color: aquamarine;">
    <q>' "The aurora forms when charged particles from the sun collide with Earth's upper atmosphere at incredible speeds —
    up to 45 million mph (72 million kph). Thankfully, our planet's magnetic field acts as a protective shield,
    preventing these solar particles from causing harm while creating the stunning spectacle we know as the northern
    lights." '</q>

  <p style="background-color: rgb(104, 104, 186); border: dashed; border-radius: 10px; border-color: black; padding: 25px; margin-bottom: 75px; margin-left: 20px;">
    <q>The northern lights give us a unique window into our sun's activity, space weather and Earth's magnetic field.

    At any given moment, the sun is ejecting charged particles from its corona, or upper atmosphere, creating the solar
    wind. When that wind slams into Earth's ionosphere, or upper atmosphere, the aurora is born. In the Northern
    Hemisphere, the phenomenon is called the northern lights (aurora borealis), while in the Southern Hemisphere, it's
    called the southern lights (aurora australis).

    "These particles are deflected towards the poles of Earth by our planet's magnetic field and interact with our
    atmosphere, depositing energy and causing the atmosphere to fluoresce," Billy Teets, the director of Dyer
    Observatory at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee told Space.com.

    The bright colors of the northern lights are dictated by the chemical composition of Earth's atmosphere.

    "Every type of atom or molecule, whether it's atomic hydrogen or a molecule like carbon dioxide, absorbs and
    radiates its own unique set of colors, which is analogous to how every human being has a unique set of
    fingerprints," Teets told Space.com.

    ' "Some of the dominant colors seen in aurorae are red, a hue produced by the nitrogen molecules, and green, which
    is produced by oxygen molecules." Teet continued.' </q>

  <h2 style="font-family: fantasy;"> Here are some commonly asked questions about these beautiful sky specticales! These are cited by
    <cite>www.space.com</cite></h2>
  <ul style="font-family: fantasy; background-color: blueviolet; border: solid; border-color: black; padding: 25px; margin-left: 20px;">
    <li><strong>What causes the movement and shape of auroras?</strong></li>
    <p>"Constantly changing input from the sun, varying responses from the Earth's upper atmosphere, and the motion of
      the planet and particles in near-Earth space all conspired to cause different auroral motions and shapes. From
      these motions and shapes, we can learn about the physics happening further out in space along the Earth's magnetic
      field lines."</p>
  </ul>
  <ul style="background-color: rgb(70, 204, 222);">
    <li><strong>What do auroras tell us about Earth's atmosphere?</strong></li>
    <p>"Auroras tell us many things about Earth's upper atmosphere, including its density, composition, flow speeds, and
      the strength of electrical currents flowing in the upper atmosphere. These in turn tell us about the Earth's
      magnetic field, how it extends into space, and how it changes dynamically. All of this is important for protecting
      Earth and space-borne technologies from hazards of "space weather" of which aurora is one part."</p>

    <li><strong>What's the best places to see the northern lights?</strong></li>
    <p><q>The northern lights are happening 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year,</q>said photographer <cite>Chad
      Blakely<cite>, owner of the northern lights tour company Lights Over Lapland. <q>But that doesn't mean they're easy to
      spot; you need to be at the right place at the right time.</q>

      <q>The best place to see the northern lights is any destination in the <q>auroral zone,</q> the area within an
      approximately 1,550-mile (2,500 kilometers) radius of the North Pole, according to the Tromsø Geophysical
      Observatory in Norway. That's where the aurora most frequently occurs, though the phenomenon can creep farther
      south during particularly strong solar storms.</q></p>
